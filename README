GAMEPLAY

The game can be played without a computer; this is detailed in the RULES
file. At present Marad is a two player game; use the mouse to select a
piece to move, then a direction for the piece to move in. Some pieces
can only move in certain directions, which should be pretty easy to
figure out. A player scores a point when a piece of theirs that moved
ends a turn in the central square.

Clicking outside the board will clear any active selection. The escape
key will do this, or after a game has been won, will start a new game.
The "Q" key will quit the game at any point.

INSTALLATION

On OpenBSD, installation might run along the lines of:

	# required system packages (may be incomplete)
	doas pkg_add gnupg sbcl sdl2

	# if one has not setup quicklisp ...
	ftp https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
	ftp https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp.asc
	gpg --recv-keys 307965AB028B5FF7
	gpg --verify quicklisp.lisp.asc
	sbcl --eval '(load "quicklisp.lisp")' \
	     --eval '(quicklisp-quickstart:install)' \
	     --eval '(quit)'

	# ... install marad into the local quicklisp
	cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
	git clone https://thrig.me/src/marad.git
	cd marad
	make run

Note that SBCL uses W^X memory operations, so /usr/local must be mounted
wxallowed, which probably is the default under OpenBSD 7.2. This can be
checked by running something like:

	$ fgrep /usr/local /etc/fstab | fgrep wxallowed || echo not ok
	38fcd6f796507fa1.h /usr/local ffs rw,wxallowed,nodev,noatime 1 2

Portability beyond SBCL and OpenBSD has not been tested.
