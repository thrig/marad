marad - an Autumn 2022 Lisp Game Jam game


INSTALLATION

On OpenBSD, installation might run along the lines of:

	# required system packages (may be incomplete)
	doas pkg_add gnupg sbcl sdl2

	# if one has not setup quicklisp ...
	ftp https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
	ftp https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp.asc
	gpg --recv-keys 307965AB028B5FF7
	gpg --verify quicklisp.lisp.asc
	sbcl --eval '(load "quicklisp.lisp")' \
	     --eval '(quicklisp-quickstart:install)' \
	     --eval '(quit)'

	# ... install marad into the local quicklisp
	cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
	git clone https://thrig.me/src/marad.git
	cd marad
	make run

Note that SBCL uses W^X memory operations, so /usr/local must be mounted
wxallowed, which probably is the default under OpenBSD 7.2. This can be
checked by running something like:

	$ fgrep /usr/local /etc/fstab | fgrep wxallowed || echo not ok
	38fcd6f796507fa1.h /usr/local ffs rw,wxallowed,nodev,noatime 1 2

Portability beyond SBCL and OpenBSD has not been tested.
